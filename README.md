Wordle Demake README
Overview
This project is a demake of the popular game Wordle, implemented for NES-style retro gaming. It captures the essence of Wordle but with a minimalistic design and retro feel, inspired by the aesthetics and limitations of older gaming systems.

Features
Classic Wordle Gameplay: Guess the correct 5-letter word within six attempts.
NES-style Graphics: Retro pixel art and UI reminiscent of classic 8-bit games.
Feedback System: Letter feedback highlights correct letters in the correct position and correct letters in the wrong position, just like the original Wordle.
Keyboard Input Simulation: Includes a virtual retro-style keyboard for guessing words.
Requirements
Platform: The game runs in an NES emulator or a compatible web-based NES player (like the one at 8bitworkshop).
Browser: A modern browser for playing in the web-based emulator.
NES Emulator: Any NES emulator if playing locally (e.g., FCEUX, Nestopia, Mesen).
How to Play
Start the Game:

To start the game, you actually want to press SPACE if you are on a computer.
Guess the Word:

Input your guess for the 5-letter word using the virtual keyboard or the emulator controls.
Feedback:

After each guess, the game will provide color-coded feedback:
Green: Letter is in the correct position.
Yellow: Letter is in the word but the wrong position.
Gray: Letter is not in the word.
Win/Lose:

Win by guessing the word within six attempts.
Lose if you fail to guess the word after six attempts.
Emulator Controls
Directional Pad: Navigate the virtual keyboard.
A Button: Select a letter.
B Button: Delete a letter.
Start: Submit your word.
Code and Customization
This demake leverages NES-style programming, including constraints like limited color palettes and sprite handling. If you're interested in customizing the code, you'll need:

8bit Workshop: Use this platform to edit and run the game.
NES Assembly Language or C: Familiarity with low-level programming for the NES is recommended for modifications.
